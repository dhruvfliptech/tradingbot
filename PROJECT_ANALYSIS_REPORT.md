## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Timeline Risk: CRITICAL**
   - 320 hours needed vs 160 hours available (1 developer)
   - **Mitigation:** Need 2-3 developers working in parallel

2. **Exchange API Risk: HIGH**
   - Binance rate limits and connectivity
   - **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling, use Kraken backup

3. **Performance Risk: HIGH**
   - Sub-100ms execution challenging
   - **Mitigation:** Colocate servers, optimize code, use compiled languages

### Business Risks
1. **Capital Risk: MEDIUM**
   - $50K at risk from day one
   - **Mitigation:** Gradual deployment, strict risk controls

2. **Regulatory Risk: MEDIUM**
   - Crypto regulations changing
   - **Mitigation:** Compliance monitoring, geographic restrictions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1. **Hire Additional Developers** - Need 2-3 total for timeline
2. **Start Binance Integration** - Critical path item
3. **Set Up Backend Infrastructure** - Enable 24/7 operation
4. **Create Development Environment** - Parallel work streams

### Architecture Changes Required
1. **From:** Browser-based React app
   **To:** Microservices architecture with dedicated backend

2. **From:** Simple polling
   **To:** WebSocket streams with sub-100ms latency

3. **From:** Basic indicators
   **To:** ML ensemble with alternative data

### Phased Capital Deployment
- Week 1: Paper trading only
- Week 2: $5,000 test capital
- Week 3: $25,000 (50% capital)
- Week 4: $50,000 (full capital)

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Execution latency: <100ms
- Uptime: >99.9%
- Concurrent pairs: 50+
- Backtest Sharpe: >1.5

### Business KPIs
- Weekly return: 3-5%
- Max drawdown: <15%
- Win rate: >60%
- Risk/reward: >2:1

## Conclusion

The project is currently at 25% completion with critical infrastructure gaps that must be addressed immediately. The 4-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with:

1. **2-3 developers** working in parallel
2. **Focus on core features** first (defer nice-to-haves)
3. **Phased approach** to risk and capital deployment
4. **Daily progress tracking** against this plan

The highest priority is establishing the backend service with Binance integration, as this blocks all other advanced features. Once the foundation is in place, the ML models and advanced strategies can be built in parallel.
