    'funding': 'Coinglass/Binance public (free)',
    'whale': 'WhaleAlert (awaiting key)',
    'sentiment': 'Groq (existing)'
}
# Why: Grok emphasized "overlooked factors" like on-chain, funding rates
```

### Phase 1 Deliverables:
- ✅ Backend running 24/7
- ✅ Composer backtesting integrated
- ✅ Multi-source data pipeline
- ✅ 50+ trading pairs capability

class TradingEnvironment:
    """
    Why: SOW requires reasoning, not rule-following
    Current: if RSI > 70: BUY (rigid)
    New: Agent learns when RSI=70 matters contextually
    """
    
    observation_space = [
        # Market data
        'price', 'volume', 'volatility',
        # Technical indicators  
        'rsi', 'macd', 'ma_20', 'ma_50',
        # Alternative data (Grok requirement)
        'funding_rate', 'whale_activity', 'sentiment',
        # Market regime
        'trend_strength', 'correlation_matrix'
    ]
    
    action_space = MultiDiscrete([
        3,  # BUY/SELL/HOLD
        5,  # Position size: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%
    ])
```

### 2.2 Reward Function Design
**Current:** No learning from outcomes  
**Required:** Self-optimization through experience  
**Solution:** Multi-objective reward

```python
def calculate_reward(action, outcome):
    """
    Why: Aligns with SOW performance targets
    - 3-5% weekly returns → profit_reward
    - Sharpe >1.5 → sharpe_reward  
    - <15% drawdown → drawdown_penalty
    - >60% win rate → consistency_bonus
    """
    
    # Profit component (but controlled with tanh to prevent greed)
    profit_reward = np.tanh(outcome.pnl / 100)
    
    # Risk-adjusted returns (SOW: Sharpe >1.5)
    sharpe_reward = outcome.sharpe * 0.3
    
    # Strict drawdown control (SOW: <15% max)
    if outcome.drawdown > 0.10:
        drawdown_penalty = -1.0 * (outcome.drawdown - 0.10) ** 2
    else:
        drawdown_penalty = 0
    
    # Consistency (SOW: >60% win rate)
    consistency = outcome.win_rate * 0.1
    
    # Exploration bonus (prevent local optima)
    exploration = -entropy(action_distribution) * 0.05
    
    return profit_reward + sharpe_reward + drawdown_penalty + consistency + exploration
```

### 2.3 Pre-training with Composer 🎵
**Current:** No historical learning  
**Required:** Learn from successful patterns  
**Solution:** Supervised pre-training

```python
# Composer provides:
✅ 1000+ successful strategies to learn from
✅ Historical trade data for supervised learning
✅ Performance metrics for each strategy

# Process:
1. Extract successful patterns from Composer backtests
2. Pre-train RL agent on these patterns
3. Deploy to Alpaca for online learning
```

### Phase 2 Deliverables:
- ✅ RL agent replacing rigid rules

    agents = {
        'conservative': ConservativeAgent(),  # Volatile markets
        'aggressive': AggressiveAgent(),      # Trending markets
        'balanced': BalancedAgent(),          # Ranging markets
        'contrarian': ContrarianAgent()       # Reversal markets
    }
    
    def select_agent(self, market_regime):
        # Meta-agent uses RL to select best performer
        return self.meta_agent.choose(market_regime, historical_performance)
```

### 4.2 Strategy Selector Bandit

        VolumeProfile(),
        RLAgent1(),
        RLAgent2()
    ]
    
    def select_strategy(self, market_state):
        # UCB balances exploration vs exploitation
        ucb_scores = self.calculate_ucb(success_rates, confidence_bounds)
        return self.strategies[np.argmax(ucb_scores)]
```

    def evaluate_risk(self, trade):
        checks = [
            self.position_sizing(),      # 5-10% per trade
            self.correlation_limits(),   # <10% correlated
            self.drawdown_control(),     # <15% max
            self.leverage_dynamic(),     # 1-5x based on confidence
            self.volatility_adjusted(),  # Reduce in high vol
            self.regime_appropriate()    # Match market conditions
        ]
        return all(checks)
```

### 5.3 Monitoring & Alerts
