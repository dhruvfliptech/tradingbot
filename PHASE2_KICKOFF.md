# Phase 2 Kickoff - Reinforcement Learning Core

## 📊 Phase 2 Status
- **Start Date:** August 15, 2025
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Completion Target:** 70% of total project
- **Focus:** Transform rigid trading rules into adaptive RL intelligence

## 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Implement PPO-based RL Agent** - Replace if-then logic with learned behavior
2. **Multi-objective Reward Function** - Balance profit, risk, and consistency
3. **Composer Pre-training** - Leverage 1000+ strategies for baseline
4. **Integration with Phase 1** - Build on AdaptiveThreshold foundation

### Deliverables Closing SOW Gaps
- ✅ "Strategies as guides, not rules" - RL learns contextual application
- ✅ Self-optimization through experience - Continuous learning loop
- ✅ 3-5 indicator cross-validation - RL evaluates multiple signals
- ✅ Performance targets (3-5% weekly) - Reward function optimization

### Integration Architecture
```
AdaptiveThreshold → Feature Extraction → RL Environment
                                              ↓
Composer Data → Pre-training → PPO Agent → Actions
                                    ↓
                            Trading Service → Execution
```

## 🧪 Testing Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Baseline:** AdaptiveThreshold performance
- **Target:** 15-20% improvement in Sharpe ratio
- **Requirement:** <15% max drawdown
- **Goal:** >60% win rate

### Validation Tests
1. **Backtesting:** 2+ years historical data
2. **Paper Trading:** 1 week minimum
3. **Stress Testing:** Market crash scenarios
4. **A/B Testing:** RL vs AdaptiveThreshold

## ⚠️ Risk Management

- **Latency:** Optimize inference, use model caching

### Business Risks
- **Performance:** Maintain AdaptiveThreshold as fallback
- **Explainability:** Log all decisions with reasoning
- **Compliance:** Ensure audit trail for all trades
