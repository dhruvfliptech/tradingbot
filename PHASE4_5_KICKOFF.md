## 💡 Implementation Strategy

### Multi-Agent Training
```python
# Different reward functions per agent
conservative_reward = emphasize_drawdown_minimization
aggressive_reward = emphasize_returns_maximization
balanced_reward = emphasize_sharpe_ratio
contrarian_reward = emphasize_mean_reversion
```

### Market Regime Detection
```python
class MarketRegimeDetector:
    def detect_regime(self, features):
        # Use HMM or clustering
        # Return: BULL, BEAR, SIDEWAYS, VOLATILE
        # Include transition probabilities
```

### Meta-Agent Selection
```python
class MetaAgent:
    def select_agent(self, regime, performance_history):
        # Use UCB or Thompson Sampling
        # Consider recent performance
        # Balance exploration/exploitation
```

### Execution Optimization
```python
# Techniques to achieve <100ms
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Connection pooling for APIs
- Redis caching for features
- NumPy vectorization for calculations
- Cython for critical paths
```
