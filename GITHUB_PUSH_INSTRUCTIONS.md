# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Option 1: Push to a New Repository (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a new GitHub repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it something like `ai-trading-bot-rl`
3. Set it to Private (for security)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Update remote and push
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Remove the old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add your new repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-trading-bot-rl.git

# Push to the new repository
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Fork and Push

If you want to maintain a connection to the original repository:

```bash
# 1. Fork the original repository on GitHub
# 2. Then update your remote to your fork:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tradingbot.git

# 3. Push to your fork
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Request Access

Contact the repository owner (dhruvfliptech) to grant you push access.

   - Settings → Branches → Add protection rule
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

4. **Share with your CTO** for review using the documentation:
   - `/PHASE_HANDOFF_DOCUMENTATION.md`
   - `/TESTING_GUIDE_PHASE1.md`
   - `/DELIVERABLES_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
