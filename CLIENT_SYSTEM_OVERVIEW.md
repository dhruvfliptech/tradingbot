## 🧠 The Intelligence Behind Your Bot

### How the AI Makes Decisions

```
Market Data → Analysis → AI Decision → Risk Check → Trade Execution
     ↑                                                      ↓
     ←←←←←←←←← Learning from Results ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

Your bot doesn't just follow rules - it **thinks** about each trade:

1. **Observes** - Watches 15+ market indicators simultaneously
2. **Analyzes** - Considers price patterns, sentiment, and on-chain data
3. **Decides** - Uses AI to select best action (buy/sell/hold)
4. **Validates** - Checks risk limits before executing
5. **Learns** - Improves strategy based on outcomes

### The Multi-Agent System

Think of your bot as having 4 expert traders working together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Your AI Trading Team                    │
├───────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬──────────┤
│ Conservative  │ Aggressive │  Balanced  │Contrarian│
│   Trader      │   Trader   │   Trader   │  Trader  │
├───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────┤
│ Protects      │ Maximizes  │ Optimizes  │ Trades   │
│ Capital       │ Returns    │ Risk/Reward│ Reversals│
└───────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴──────────┘
                         ↓
              Meta-Agent (Team Leader)
                Selects best trader for
                current market conditions
```
